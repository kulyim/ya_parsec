# ya_parsec
Yet another parsec demo (WIP)

Here is an experiment in functional parsing in php. In the parsec.php file, only the minimum number of parsers are defined to make the example work, but more can easily be defined.

# TODO
* Replace default infinite lookahead with single character lookahead and optional infinite lookahead
* Add error handling
